# test_TDD = Test-Driven Development - the tests drive the
# development

# Unit Tests - a unit is a small component
# breakdown program into individual functions, classes etc. to test
# advantage - code you write will be easy to test

# RED --> GREEN LOOP

# 1. Write tests
# 2. Run the test - -> FAIL (RED) - should fail as no code
# 3. Write code, to get the test to pass
# 4. Run the test --> SUCCESS (GREEN)
# 5. Refactor (GO TO 1) - might have to go through this loop a coupla times

# FAIL --> PASS --> REFACTOR (REPEAT)

# Test Coverage - how much of our code we develop is covered by code

# unit tests are all about being lightweight and giving very fast feedback
# test_TDD changes the way you code - if you start with unit tests already thinking about how
# we will test our code
